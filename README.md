# Movie-Comparison-API-app
This is my first 'big' JavaScript project that I completed from an online bootcamp hosted by the amazing Colt Steele and Stephen Grider.
Concepts of professional development such as application design patterns and planning were challenged and practiced here.

All of this code was refactored in the process to unpack, process and deliver data from an API using axios. It really opened my eyes to the bigger picture
involved with team work and futurproofing any code to accept new scenarios.

An amazing experience for a beginner like me!
